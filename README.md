roundingNumbers
===============

This python code rounds positive numbers by the tenth place and prints the new integer.

This is the second python challenge I've completed. Used docs.python.org, Udacity class notes and previous python project as references. The assingment wanted an "if"less, "round"less and "int"less code, but I couldn't conceive of how to go about printing the correct answer without the if, else statement. 

After reviewing the answer the integer can be rounded up by adding .5 to the tenth place. One of those answers that's right at the nose and too easy/close to see! Simpler than creating an if/else statement even if more rudimentary.
